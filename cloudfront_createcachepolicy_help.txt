       Creates a cache policy.

       After you create a cache policy, you can attach it to one or more cache
       behaviors. When it's attached to a cache behavior, the cache policy
       determines the following:

       +o The values that CloudFront includes in the _c_a_c_h_e _k_e_y . These values
         can include HTTP headers, cookies, and URL query strings. CloudFront
         uses the cache key to find an object in its cache that it can return
         to the viewer.

       +o The default, minimum, and maximum time to live (TTL) values that you
         want objects to stay in the CloudFront cache.

       The headers, cookies, and query strings that are included in the cache
       key are also included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.
       CloudFront sends a request when it can't find an object in its cache
       that matches the request's cache key. If you want to send values to the
       origin but _n_o_t include them in the cache key, use OOrriiggiinnRReeqquueessttPPoolliiccyy .

          A cache policy configuration.

          Comment -> (string)
             A comment to describe the cache policy. The comment cannot be
             longer than 128 characters.

          Name -> (string)
             A unique name to identify the cache policy.

          DefaultTTL -> (long)
             The default amount of time, in seconds, that you want objects to
             stay in the CloudFront cache before CloudFront sends another
             request to the origin to see if the object has been updated.
             CloudFront uses this value as the object's time to live (TTL)
             only when the origin does _n_o_t send CCaacchhee--CCoonnttrrooll or EExxppiirreess
             headers with the object. For more information, see _M_a_n_a_g_i_n_g _H_o_w

             the value of MMiinnTTTTLL is more than 86400 seconds, then the default
             value for this field is the same as the value of MMiinnTTTTLL .

          MaxTTL -> (long)
             The maximum amount of time, in seconds, that objects stay in the
             CloudFront cache before CloudFront sends another request to the
             origin to see if the object has been updated. CloudFront uses
             this value only when the origin sends CCaacchhee--CCoonnttrrooll or EExxppiirreess

             The default value for this field is 31536000 seconds (one year).
             If the value of MMiinnTTTTLL or DDeeffaauullttTTTTLL is more than 31536000

          MinTTL -> (long)
             The minimum amount of time, in seconds, that you want objects to
             stay in the CloudFront cache before CloudFront sends another

             EnableAcceptEncodingGzip -> (boolean)
                A flag that can affect whether the AAcccceepptt--EEnnccooddiinngg HTTP header
                is included in the cache key and included in requests that

                If one or both of these fields is ttrruuee  _a_n_d the viewer request
                includes the AAcccceepptt--EEnnccooddiinngg header, then CloudFront does the
                following:

                +o Normalizes the value of the viewer's AAcccceepptt--EEnnccooddiinngg header

                +o Includes the normalized header in the cache key

                     If both of these fields are ffaallssee , then CloudFront

                     included in the cache key and it's not included in origin
                     requests. In this case, you can manually add
                     AAcccceepptt--EEnnccooddiinngg to the headers whitelist like any other
