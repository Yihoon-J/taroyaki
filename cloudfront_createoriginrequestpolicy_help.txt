       Creates an origin request policy.

       After you create an origin request policy, you can attach it to one or
       more cache behaviors. When it's attached to a cache behavior, the
       origin request policy determines the values that CloudFront includes in
       requests that it sends to the origin. Each request that CloudFront
       sends to the origin includes the following:

       +o The request body and the URL path (without the domain name) from the
         viewer request.

       +o The headers that CloudFront automatically includes in every origin
         request, including HHoosstt , UUsseerr--AAggeenntt , and XX--AAmmzz--CCff--IIdd .

       +o All HTTP headers, cookies, and URL query strings that are specified
         in the cache policy or the origin request policy. These can include
         items from the viewer request and, in the case of headers, additional
         ones that are added by CloudFront.

       CloudFront sends a request when it can't find a valid object in its
       cache that matches the request. If you want to send values to the
       origin and also include them in the cache key, use CCaacchheePPoolliiccyy .

       base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves
       compatibility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed
       literally. When providing contents from a file that map to a binary
